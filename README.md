THE_ODIN_PROJECT : ETCH A SKETCH

Project 3 of the Foundations Course (JavaScript Part)

In this project, the grid is initially set at a 16x16 size but the user can change the grid as long as it is
between 0 and 100. 

The hardest part for me, was how to begin and how to construct the grid with javascript. 

Future amelioration : the possibility to change the colour when mouse is hovering the grid.
